quiz 1

1.
Asking the right question.	

2. Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.

3 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.	

4 Accuracy

5 9%	


quiz 2

1. 
adData = data.frame(diagnosis,predictors)
testIndex = createDataPartition(diagnosis, p = 0.50,list=FALSE)
training = adData[-testIndex,]
testing = adData[testIndex,]


2. There is a step-like pattern in the plot of outcome versus index in the training set that isn't explained by any of the predictor variables so there may be a variable missing.

3. There are a large number of values that are the same and even if you took the log(SuperPlasticizer + 1) they would still all be identical so the distribution would not be symmetric.

4 9

5 Non-PCA Accuracy: 0.65 
PCA Accuracy: 0.72



quiz 3 

a. PS 
b. WS 
c. PS
d. Not possible to predict 

2. The bias is larger and the variance is smaller. Under leave one out cross validation K is equal to the sample size.

3 2.875. It is strange because Area should be a qualitative variable - but tree is reporting the average value of Area as a numeric variable in the leaf predicted for newdata

4. Test Set Misclassification: 0.31 
Training Set: 0.2

5. he order of the variables is:
x.2, x.1, x.5, x.6, x.8, x.4, x.9, x.3, x.7,x.10
